# Awesome OpenAI Apps SDK

A curated list of examples and resources for the OpenAI Apps SDK.

## What is the OpenAI Apps SDK?

The OpenAI Apps SDK is a developer toolkit that extends the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling developers to design both the logic and interface of applications that run inside ChatGPT. The SDK allows you to:

- Define your app's chat logic and interface
- Connect to your existing backend for authentication and premium features
- Run your app inside ChatGPT and anywhere else that adopts the MCP standard
- Build apps in developer mode and test them before submission

The Apps SDK is open source and currently in preview mode. Apps built with the SDK will be discoverable in the ChatGPT app directory when it opens for submissions later this year.
