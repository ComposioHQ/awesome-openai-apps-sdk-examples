[
  {
    "id": "unique-id",
    "originalUrl": "https://example.com/long-url",
    "shortCode": "abc123",
    "customAlias": "my-link",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "expiresAt": "2024-02-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "clicks": 42,
    "clickDetails": [],
    "tags": ["marketing", "campaign"],
    "description": "Campaign landing page"
  }
]
```

## Short Code Generation

- Random codes: 8-character nanoid (URL-safe)
- Custom aliases: Letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores only
- Collision detection prevents duplicate codes
- Case-sensitive codes

## Analytics Features

- Total clicks per link
- Click timestamps
- Recent click history
- Top-performing links
- Tag-based analytics
- Average clicks per link

## Link Expiration

- Set expiration in days when creating
- Expired links are marked in stats
- Expired links remain in database (can be deleted manually)
- No automatic cleanup (preserves analytics)

## Best Practices

### URL Validation
- Always include protocol (http:// or https://)
- Validate URLs before shortening
- Test shortened links after creation

### Custom Aliases
- Keep aliases short and memorable
- Use hyphens for readability (my-link not mylink)
- Avoid special characters
- Check availability before creation

### Tagging Strategy
- Use consistent tag names
- Create tag hierarchies (marketing/email, marketing/social)
- Don't over-tag (2-4 tags per link)
- Use descriptive tags

### Link Management
- Add descriptions for future reference
- Set expiration for temporary campaigns
- Regular cleanup of old links
- Archive instead of delete for records

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Invalid URL" error
- Ensure URL includes http:// or https://
- Check for typos in URL
- Test URL in browser first

**Issue**: "Custom alias already exists"
- Choose a different alias
- Check existing links with `list_links`
- Use random generation instead

**Issue**: Links not persisting
- Check write permissions on data/ directory
- Verify data/links.json exists and is valid JSON
- Check disk space

**Issue**: Can't find short code
- Verify correct short code (case-sensitive)
- Use `list_links` to see all codes
- Check if link was deleted

## Performance

- In-memory operations for fast access
- Efficient persistence to JSON file
- Suitable for thousands of links
- O(1) lookup by short code
- O(n log n) sorting for analytics

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Link editing (change destination URL)
- Bulk operations
- Import/export CSV
- Click analytics dashboard
- Geographic tracking
- QR code generation integration
- Custom domain support
- API rate limiting
- Link previews
